# Reflection</br>

This was a month long project built during the ReactJS June 2020 module at SoftUni. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with ReactJS.</br>
Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to read and create posts based on what they are interested in. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in learning about components, props, states and component life cycle methods.</br>

The RESTful API is built with Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose and MongoDB and supports authentication using jsonwebtoken.</br>
