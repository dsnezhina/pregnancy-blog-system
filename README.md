# Reflection

This was a month long project built during the ReactJS June 2020 module at SoftUni. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with ReactJS.
Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to read and create posts based on what they are interested in. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in learning about components, props, states and component life cycle methods.

The RESTful API is built with Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose and MongoDB and supports authentication using jsonwebtoken.
